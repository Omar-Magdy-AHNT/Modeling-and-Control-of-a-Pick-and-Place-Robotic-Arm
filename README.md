# Modeling and Control of a Pick and Place Robotic Arm 

### Description  
This project involves a 4-DOF robotic arm designed and simulated using Simscape and CoppeliaSim. The motion functionality includes pick-and-place operations, developed in collaboration with another team responsible for the pierce function. The system was tested in both simulation (MATLAB and CoppeliaSim) and on a real robotic arm for proof of concept.

### Report  
For a detailed explanation of the methodology, simulations, and results, please refer to the [report](/Report.pdf) available in this repository. It includes in-depth discussions on control strategies, implementation details, and performance evaluation.
